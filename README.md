# PWM-Generator

The above project implements an advanced PWM generator module in Verilog. 
It includes configurable parameters such as clock, reset, duty cycle, duty cycle increase/decrease, frequency, enable, and PWM output. 
The module supports duty cycle adjustments, frequency changes, and enables multi-channel PWM generation. 
The provided testbench validates the functionality of the module by simulating various scenarios and verifying the PWM output.
